    <h2><b><a name="1. Overview"> </a>1. Overview</b></h2>

    <p>WLU Go is a web application that allows users to view, rate, and review the courses offered at Wilfrid Laurier
        University (WLU). It would help students get an idea of what a course is like by reading reviews and different
        rating parameters. As of now, there is no dedicated way for WLU students to get a thorough understanding of the
        courses offered other than through word of mouth. We want WLU Go to be a one-stop universal web application that
        is easily accessible and provides information on any WLU course with just a quick course code search.&nbsp;</p>
        <h4><b><a name ="1.1 Purpose and Scope">1.1 Purpose and Scope</a></b></h4>
    <p>This document outlines the requirements of WLU Go, a web application that will allow WLU students to leave course
        reviews and ratings. This document is targeted towards the developers and to any users who want a deeper
        understanding of the application and its uses.</p>
    <p>The scope of the project is a fully functional web-based application that allows Wilfrid Laurier University
        students access to information on every course offered at the university. The objective of WLU Go is to help
        students gain a better understanding of WLU courses based on the experiences of others, desired birdness
        (difficulty), enjoyability, and usefulness. Through the use of this application, students will have an easier
        time deciding which courses to take.</p>
        <h4><b><a name ="1.2 Intended Audience">1.2 Intended Audience</a></b></h4>
    <p>The intended audience for this web application is future and current Wilfrid Laurier University students who are
        looking to get some insight on the courses which they will potentially take or want to leave some knowledge
        about their experience with their respective course. In addition, the users of this web application are expected
        to have a basic understanding of how to use a modern website and internet browser. It will be helpful but not
        necessary if users have previous experience with other community-like social platforms (e.g. Reddit or
        Facebook). With this prior expertise, users will be comfortable using some of the features WLU Go has to offer,
        such as a comment system, rating network, and feedback loop.</p>
        <h4><b><a name ="1.3 Constraints">1.3 Constraints</a></b></h4>
    <p>Multiple users must be able to access the website at the same time. To ensure that the web application is
        reliable, speedy, and smooth, reviews and user comments should be updated within a 5-second window of when they
        were originally sent by the student.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is assumed that there will be no cost constraints. There might be some constraints in the development cycle of
        this web application. This includes the potential reliability constraints depending on which Frameworks or APIs
        are used. In addition, there can be possible time constraints with the development cycle with the
        scrapping/gathering of large data and importing those figures into the database.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Further, select members of the team will be expected to learn and use the technologies which will be deployed
        during this project. Members might have to gain some additional knowledge on some front-end or back-end
        technology stacks that will be used for the creation of the web application. This might add to the overall time
        constraint of this project, which needs to be finished in July/August.</p>
        <h4><b><a name ="1.4 Assumptions and Dependencies">1.4 Assumptions and Dependencies</a></b></h4>
    <p>It is assumed that all users will have some sort of modern internet browser (e.g. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge,
        Mozilla Firefox, etc.). This web application can be accessed both via a computer or a mobile device.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Users are also expected to have a stable internet connection for the entire duration of their session. As well,
        WLU Go should be compatible with any modern operating system (e.g. Windows 10, Chrome OS 90, Mac OS 10,
        etc.).&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This outlines the agreed-upon methods and techniques that are to be followed till the completion of the
        process.&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Communication&nbsp;</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The team will use discord to communicate and ensure that we stay on track. For the various teams such as
                frontend, backend, and full-stack specific channels have been created and each will have the autonomy to
                set up their own meetings.</li>

        <li>Tools&nbsp;</li>
        <ul>
            <li>IDE</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The teams will be using VS Code as their editor and can use any external plugins that will allow
                    them to code optimally.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Documentation in the code will be done using hashtags and more detailed ones will be done using
                    multiline strings.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>All functions/methods in the backend will be written in multiline strings and will contain the aim
                    of the function, the arguments, and the expected returns.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Git</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Each time will have a specific branch to deploy their code</li>
                <li>The commits made will need to meet the standards defined by the teams</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Database&nbsp;</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To help with designing the database schema external tools such as dbdiagram.io will be utilized.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>The database used will be MYSQL and will be deployed to a cloud provider such as Google
                Cloud/AWS/Azure.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>For database management such as managing external access to the database and querying the database, the
                backend team will use MYSQL workbench.</li>

    <h4><b><a name ="7.1 Verification Plans">7.1 Verification Plans</a></b></h4>
    <p>The verification and validation process focuses on ensuring that the standards set are consistently observed.
        This verification process is what the SQA process is intended to achieve.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Verification will involve ensuring:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accuracy&nbsp;</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This process ensures that the final product at each phase of the project lines up with what was detailed
                in the requirements documentation of the project.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Up-to-date Documentation</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Consistent update to the documentation to include new features, remove features that cannot be delivered
                or provide more comprehensive features regarding certain features. The details in the documentation will
                be used to assess the success of the final product hence it is essential to have it be as accurate as
                possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Functionality&nbsp;</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This portion involves ensuring that the code meets the functional requirements that were drafted. For
                this to be achieved the frontend and backend teams will have to perform functionality testing and will
                need to test their code to ensure that no syntax or logic errors are embedded.</li>
            <li>Additionally, team members that did not take part in writing the code will also test it thus completing
                the code quality assurance cycle.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4><b><a name ="7.2 Problem Resolution">7.2 Problem Resolution</a></b></h4>
    <p>As noted above the management team will be responsible for ensuring that the deadlines are met. In case any
        issues arise below are the potential avenues to solve the problems:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Re-allocating tasks to ensure that they are completed on time.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Allowing more time for individuals to complete the assigned parts of the project/assignments.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Following up with team members on the progress of the tasks that they need to do.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Scheduling meetings whether general or between the specific teams to discuss progress or changes to
            specification and documentation.</li>
